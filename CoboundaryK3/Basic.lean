The permutation coboundary constant of the complete complex is k/3 for 4 ≤ k ≤ 8
(Jeromie Beasley, DOI 10.5281/zenodo.22090958): the machine-checked witnesses.

Conventions follow the paper (Sec. 1 and Appendix B). Permutations of `{0,1,2}` act on points;
the Hamming count `moved σ` is the number of points `σ` moves. A 1-cochain on the complete
complex `K_k` assigns `α u v` to each edge `u < v`, with `α(v,u) = α(u,v)⁻¹`. Its triangle
defect is `N = Σ_{u<v<w} moved(α(u,v) α(v,w) α(w,u))` and the cost of a gauge
`β : Fin k → Sym(3)` is `Σ_{u<v} moved(β(u)⁻¹ α(u,v) β(v))`; `D` is the minimum cost over every
gauge. Both are counts of moved points, so `N/D` is the paper's counting ratio.

This file proves, for each witness of Appendix A, the defect `N`, that no gauge costs less than
`D`, and that `D` is attained, so that `N/D = k/3`. With the Chapman–Lubotzky lower bound
`h₁(K_k, Sym) ≥ k/3` (cited, Proposition 1) this is the upper half of Theorem 3.

The gauge minimum is checked by exhausting every gauge with `β(0) = 1`; `gauge_lower` proves that
this loses nothing, because right multiplication by a constant conjugates every edge term.

/-! ### Branch-and-bound exhaustion

Assign the gauge one vertex at a time. The cost of the edges whose endpoints are both assigned
can only grow as more vertices are assigned, so once it reaches `D` every completion costs at
least `D` and the branch is closed. `search_sound` proves this pruning loses nothing. -/
